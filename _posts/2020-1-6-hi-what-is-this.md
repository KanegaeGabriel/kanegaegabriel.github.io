title: Hi! What is This?
---

I... am not sure, actually. The first idea was to create this website to play a bit with front-end development (which I've always avoided and rarely did), as well as have something to show off to potential recruiters and people in general. But, in the process of mindstorming it and writing a little bit, it felt like the greatest thing since sliced bread. **This is my first try at writing stuff for other people to read outside of school work, as well as my first time writing more than a handful of paragraphs in English**, and I'm enjoying it way more than I expected.

As of right now, **the plan is for this to be a personal blog with posts about things I am passionate about**. Computer Science? University? Tech? Learning? Games? Books? I guess we'll see. If there are posts dated previous to this one, they were written before the website was created or are part of the "little bit" mentioned above, and probably are about past events or projects.

All in all, there's no concrete goal or schedule. Just a side project and maybe even a new hobby.
